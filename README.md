# Games n' Tools

This is Games n' Tools, it includes nearly 10 games and tools(nearly 20 in total)

# How To Install ?

You can either download the zip or clon with Git. If you downloaded the zip, unzip it. And you're done! Get a look at "How To Run ?" to see... You know... How to run!

# No Python Required !

The respository has its own python inside it(and its very unstable so better not touch the code if you don't know what you are doing)
So you don't need to install python on your computer, just clone or install the respository and you're ready

# How To Run ?

Just run the Games n' Tools.bat file and my code will do the rest!

# IMPORTANT !

The script runs directly in the games-n-tools directory, if you try to run main.py in assets folder by yourself, you're gonna mess up(not if you're a programmer like me!)
